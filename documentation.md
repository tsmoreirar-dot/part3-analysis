The third part is focused on running queries over the final dataset formatted in stage 2.

I used duckdb as well to run queries and extract some metrics from what the dataset is able to provide.

What We're Looking For
● Can you make business sense out of raw data?
● Do you understand what metrics matter in e-commerce?
● Can you communicate clearly to non-technical executives?
● What do you prioritize as important vs. noise?

1. Can you make business sense out of raw data?
Yes, but limited. The dataset itself does not provide enough data for us to evaluate key metrics like cost of acquisition or return on ad spends/impressions. I focused on what the dataset alone provided, understanding where the traffic is coming from, what is our current conversion for the period, and what we can focus for quick improvements.

2. Do you understand what metrics matter in e-commerce?
The ones I usually see more focus and meaning are:
- overall traffic, and monitor this to spot if our brand is becoming more or less relevant
- page load, if the experience is bad we can not retain customers until the end of the journey
- click-through-rate, to see if people are clicking the ads we are sending them. Lower CTR means we are not paying for bidding to the better customers.
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC) and the same for specific campaigns (usually CPA). Key objective is to lower our cost of acquisition by improving our targeting.
- Conversion and abandoned cart, to see how many are converting and how many are dropping close to the end of the journey.

3. Can you communicate clearly to non-technical executives?
Most of my recent experience has been in leading products and people, so working on analysis and sharing meaningful results has been the focus. I can navigate between both areas and adjust my speech accordingly.

4. What do you prioritize as important vs. noise?
It is important to ensure that bot traffic is disconsidered, as this could lead to bad metrics. When comparing organic to paid conversions and traffic, while it is important to increase organic, I put more importance in ensuring that we are getting worth for what we are paying to ad networks, as not having things configured properly would bring a direct loss to our business.
